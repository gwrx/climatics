# CLIMATICS - A foolish approach to controlling weather

You take:
* A really, really cheap AC
* fix it! Of course it's broken
* grab a RaspberryPi, a coin acceptor, some sensors
* take this repository and fix it! Of course it's broken
* screw everthing to a wall and enjoy
  * eventualy you'd have to fix something else too...
